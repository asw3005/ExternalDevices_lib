      32.875kHz or 1Hz - 128Hz CMOS Push-Pull Output (50% Duty Cycle).

      Enable CLKO output by setting ENCLKO bit to 1 in the RTC_config2 register (4h). This
      output operates on either power supply. This pin can be left open circuit if not
      used.

      Active-Low Interrupt.

      This pin is used to output an alarm or interrupt. This is an open-drain output and 
      requires an external pullup resistor.

      Square-Wave output.

      This pin is used to output a temperature-compensated square wave with programmable frequency
      from 1Hz to 32Hz. This is an open-drain and requires an extermal pullup resistor. If not use,
      connect to ground.
